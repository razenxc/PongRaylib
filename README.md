# Pong - Game
Pong is a table tennisâ€“themed twitch arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972.
~~This variant of the game is my first game written in C++~~ This isn't, I wrote this immediately after the tutorial from YouTube and added a little of my own. Actually, [this is my first game which I wrote **myself**](https://github.com/razenxc/PongSFML).
